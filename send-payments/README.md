# Send Payments

## Send Payments API

Send Payments API enables you to send money from your IntaSend API to another IntaSend account or an external wallet such M-Pesa B2C, M-Pesa B2B, and bank.

First and foremost, all requests in send money API require [authentication](api-authentication.md). You can obtain your authentication keys from your IntaSend dashboard. We also have a [sandbox (developers test environment)](../sandbox-and-live-environments.md#sandbox-development-environment) where you can test your integration before going live.
