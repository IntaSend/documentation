# Introduction

IntaSend enables businesses to receive and disburse payments. Supported channels are mobile, card, and bank payments. 

### How to start collecting payments

We provide various tools for payment collection. If you would like to receive payment without any integration to your website or mobile application, use [payment links](payment-collection/payment-links.md). Please also check out the following guides for other options for your use case.

### How to start sending money

Use our transfer API to handle disbursement and P2P transfers. The API is REST-based and requires authentication. Please go through our [OAuth 2.O](api-prerequisite/api-authentication.md) guide for more details on how to get started.
