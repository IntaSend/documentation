# Wallet as a service

Wallets API enables you to extend IntaSend's capability and automate your payment workflows. This API requires [authentication](../send-payments/api-authentication.md).

Here are some of the use-cases you can build using our wallets API:

* Mobile banking and micro-lending applications
* Ecommerce vendors payments and collection systems
* Charges tracking and reconciliation solution
* A crowdfunding solution where each campaign is tied to a single wallet for easy reconciliation and reports.
* Wallet solution for gaming and e-sports

There are so many other use-cases that our API can support. Please feel free to [contact us](../api-support.md) in case you need any clarification.

Follow the guides below to get started with our REST API.
